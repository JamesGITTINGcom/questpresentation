  Telemachus.

## Parallels

- Mulan

    - Clumsy

    - Not respected by her family

# Call to adventure

## Mulan

- Witnesses her father being conscripted and knows he will die in war

- Decides to pretend to disguise herself as male to save her father

- Mulan's motivation for adventure is saving her father, while in the Odyssey
  the King's motivation is to save his people

## Odyssey

# Refusal of the call

## Mulan

- Doubts her disguising abilities and almost gives up in front of the training
  camp

- Mushu convinces her to go anyway

## Odyssey

- He does not want to leave his family and sail to Troy; he knows it will be
  a long trip.

- Mulan fears for herself, while Odysseus fear for others

- This shows that Odysseus believes in himself, while Mulan does not

# Meeting with the mentor

## Mulan

- Mulan meets with the captain and is inspired by his ridiculing to be a better
  soldier

- Mulan does not have a person that constantly guards her, while Odysseus does,
  which may indicate that Odysseus' struggles were much more difficult

## Odyssey

- Athena, the Goddess of wisdom, crafts, and battle is Odysseus' guide. She
  wants to help Odysseus, though she has been instructed not to. She takes pity
  on him while other gods forsake Odysseus, constantly saves him from death,
  and gives him guidance.

# Crossing the threshold

## Mulan

- Mulan comes to be respected by the others in the army for her skill

## Odyssey

- After the war, the gods become angry with the Greeks for their prideful ways.
  A great storm emerges and throws them off course.

- Odysseus does not have a real _threshold_ to cross, but Mulan does, implying
  that his journey will be longer and more drawn out

# Tests, allies, enemies

## Mulan

- Mulan improves her skills and becomes even better at being male

- Mulan has only vague "montage-y" tests, allies, enemies in the form of
  training, while Odysseus has real obstacles to overcome

- Repeatedly it is implied that Mulan's journey will be soft and easy, while
  the King's journey has real life-or-death scenarios, and maybe a sad ending

    - Polyphemus

    - Circones

  going to war

## Odyssey

  to Odysseus by Aeolus, god of the winds. When the bag is opened, it releases
  a wind that blows them far away from Ithaca.

# Supreme ordeal

## Mulan

- Army is ambushed by the Huns who are hiding behind the summit of the mountain

- All hope is lost

- Mulan saves everyone by firing a rocket into an overhang of snow, causing an
  avalanche

- She kills almost everyone, but some of the army survive (hmm... I wonder why
  only the main characters survive..)

- Mulan was wounded, and after being undressed to tend to her wound, the rest
  of the army realises she is female

## Odyssey

- Odysseus is sent to the underworld seeking information to guide him home.
  This quest brings him to the verge of death.

# Reward

## Mulan

- Instead of the reward going to the hero, it goes to the others in the army
  after they realise Mulan is female

- The reward consists of beating the Huns and not perishing

- Mulan is left to perish in the snow with Mushu, the cricket and her horse

## Odyssey

- The King of Phaeacia gives Odysseus passage home.

# The road back

## Mulan

- Mulan realises most of the Huns did _not_ die in the avalanche after all, and
  decides to make her way towards the Imperial Palace

- She decides that she is obligated to save China, instead of just going home

- Mulan arrives at the Imperial palace and attempts to convince the others that
  the Huns are in fact _not_ dead, and that they are there, trying to murder
  the Emperor

## Odyssey

- Unlike other heroes, Odysseus was not in search of treasure. Instead, he was
  desperately trying to reach his home. Once he returns, he finds out that his
  house has been overrun with suitors trying to steal his wife and palace.

# Resurrection

## Mulan

- No one believes her, becuase they belive that Mulan cannot be trusted as she
  had alreaddy lied to them before

- The huns reveal themselves, and the remaining members of the army, directed
  by the captain, attempt to ram the Imerial Palace's doors open, to no avail

- Mulan eventually convinces all members of the army to join her in her plan to
  disguuise themselves as women

- Mulan's plan succeeds, and she is rewarded by the Emperor by being offered
  a seat on the Imperial Council. which she declines

## Odyssey

- Instead of rushing in and killing the suitors, Odysseus is patient. He wishes
  to learn if his wife has been faithful. With the help of his son and a loyal
  swineherd, he devises a plan. Athena disguises him as an old beggar so that
  he can enter his house undetected. Telemachus steals all the suitorsâ€™
  weapons, and a final test is proposed. Penelope will marry the man who
  strings Odysseus' bow and shoots an arrow through a line of small circles;
  a seemingly impossible task.

# Return with the elixir

## Mulan

- Instead, the Emperor hands Mulan a sword and a necklace

- Mulan returns home with the captain in tow to the delight of her family

- Mulan's family is also impressed with the gifts Mulan recieved

## Odyssey

- Odysseus, still dressed as a beggar, completes the task and is restored to
  his original state. He and his son expel the suitors from their home by
  force. Penelope, seeing how Odysseus has changed, tests him to make sure it
  is actually him. She tells him she moved their bed. He replies, correctly,
  that this would have been impossible, and all is returned to normal.
