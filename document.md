  decides to make her way towards the Imperial Palace

- She decides that she is obligated to save China, instead of just going home

- Mulan arrives at the Imperial palace and attempts to convince the others that
  the Huns are in fact _not_ dead, and that they are there, trying to murder
  the Emperor

## Odyssey

- Instead, he was desperately trying to reach his home

- Once he returns, he finds out that his house has been overrun with suitors
  trying to steal his wife and palace

## Comparison

    - In this case, Mulan's story is much more dramatic and heroic

    - Trying to save China!

- Odyssey

    - Much more noble

    - Not as dramatic

    - Lower stakes

# Resurrection

## Mulan

- No one believes her, because they believe that Mulan cannot be trusted as she
  had already lied to them before

- The Huns reveal themselves, and the remaining members of the army, directed
  by the captain, attempt to ram the Imperial Palace's doors open, to no avail

  disguise themselves as women

  a seat on the Imperial Council, which she declines

  undetected

- Telemachus steals all the suitorsâ€™ weapons, and a final test is proposed

- Penelope will marry the man who strings Odysseus' bow and shoots an arrow
  through a line of small circles; a seemingly impossible task

## Comparison

- Mulan

    - Much more dramatic

    - Not very patient or mature

- Odyssey

    - Very mature way to handle situation

    - Cunning

- Implies that Odysseus is mature and clever, while Mulan's plan is just brute
  fore with a bit of disguising

# Return with the elixir

## Mulan

- Instead, the Emperor hands Mulan a sword and a necklace

- Mulan returns home with the captain in tow to the delight of her family

- Mulan's family is also impressed with the gifts Mulan received

## Odyssey

- Odysseus, still dressed as a beggar, completes the task and is restored to
  his original state

- He and his son expel the suitors from their home by force

- Penelope, seeing how Odysseus has changed, tests him to make sure it is
  actually him

- She tells him she moved their bed

- He replies, correctly, that this would have been impossible, and all is
  returned to normal

## Comparison

- Both noble and dramatic

- Odyssey slightly more dramatic IMHO

- Mulan scenario very unrealistic

- Assuming all mystical creatures are real, Odyssey scenario quite realistic
