## Odyssey

- Instead of rushing in and killing the suitors, Odysseus is patient. He wishes
  to learn if his wife has been faithful. With the help of his son and a loyal
  swineherd, he devises a plan. Athena disguises him as an old beggar so that
  he can enter his house undetected. Telemachus steals all the suitorsâ€™
  weapons, and a final test is proposed. Penelope will marry the man who
  strings Odysseus' bow and shoots an arrow through a line of small circles;
  a seemingly impossible task.

  his original state. He and his son expel the suitors from their home by
  force. Penelope, seeing how Odysseus has changed, tests him to make sure it
  is actually him. She tells him she moved their bed. He replies, correctly,
  that this would have been impossible, and all is returned to normal.
